# Model Store Examples

This directory contains examples of training models and storing them into a model store.

## Pre-requisites

As with the main library, these scripts have been developed using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

## Set up

Start by `cd`'ing into the directory containing the example you want to run:

```bash
❯ cd examples-by-ml-model/
```

And then you can use this `Makefile` command that creates a new virtual environment
and installs all of the requirements:

```bash
❯ make pyenv
```

## Running all of the examples

Start by `cd`'ing into the directory containing the example you want to run:

```bash
❯ cd examples-by-ml-model/
```

After creating a virtual environment, you can run all of the examples using:

```bash
❯ make run
```
